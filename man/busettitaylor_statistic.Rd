\arguments{
  \item{x}{
x is a vector or a time series object containing the relevant time series values.
}
  \item{tau_0}{
  The test statistic is recursively calculated for subsamples of the time series. tau_0 gives the fraction for the smallest subsample to be considered. So if your sample is 100 and tau_0 is 0.2, the smalles subsample consists of 20 data points.
